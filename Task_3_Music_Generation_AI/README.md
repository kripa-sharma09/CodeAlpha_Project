# 🎵 AI Music Generation — CodeAlpha Internship Task 3  

> Where AI meets creativity — original tunes composed by Artificial Intelligence!  

---

## 📖 Project Overview  

This project demonstrates how AI can generate music by learning patterns from MIDI datasets.  
Built using *LSTM Neural Networks*, the model predicts sequences of notes based on trained patterns.  
Key features include:  
- 🎶 Data preprocessing with music21  
- 🧠 Deep LSTM model with random seed & temperature sampling  
- 🎨 Streamlit app for music generation & download  
- ✅ Proof-of-concept showcasing AI’s creative potential
